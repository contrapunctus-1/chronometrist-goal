1. [X] User defines targets for tasks
2. [X] Chronometrist displays targets column
3. [-] Notify user when
   + [ ] approaching target (e.g. -5 minutes)
   + [ ] target completed
   + [ ] exceeding target (target+5)
   + [X] More flexible way to define alerts.
   + [X] If time goals are defined and there is a task without a goal, just remind the user every 15 minutes of the time they've spent on it
     - [X] Needs an even more flexible way to define alerts...
   + [-] Handle manual file changes; on file change -
     - [ ] clearing existing notifications
     - [X] if last expression has a :stop value, stop alert timers
   + [ ] Also take time spent so far into account (e.g. don't start approach or complete alerts again if time has been exceeded and we're starting the task again despite that)
4. [ ] no-goal-alert - show both current interval and time spent today (it's a little alarming to see "you've spent 2 hours on X" for something you clocked into five minutes ago.)
